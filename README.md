Features

The Book Library project includes the following features:

2. Book Management - Users can view, edit, and delete books in the system. Each book includes information such as the title, author, year, and summary.
3. Form Validation - When adding or editing a book, form validation ensures that all required fields are completed correctly before the book can be saved.
4. AuthGuard - The AuthGuard protects authenticated routes, so unauthenticated users cannot access them.

1. React JS - for building the user interface.
2. Node.js - for the server-side code and the development environment.
3. CSS - to style the user interface.
